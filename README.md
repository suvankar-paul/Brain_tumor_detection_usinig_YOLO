# Brain_tumor_classification
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain tumors from MRI scans as benign or malignant. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model is deployed through Flask, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions. Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras  and Flask.
