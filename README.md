# Brain_tumor_detection_using_YOLO

This project focuses on detecting and localizing brain tumors from MRI images using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The aim is to leverage the speed and accuracy of YOLO for real-time or near real-time medical image analysis, helping in early and precise tumor detection.
